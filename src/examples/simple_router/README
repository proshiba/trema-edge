This directory includes an OpenFlow controller that controls a single
OpenFlow switch and emulates a router.

# How to run 

Run this

 % sudo ./trema run ./src/examples/simple_router/simple-router.rb -c ./src/examples/simple_router/simple_router_netns.conf -d 

and send packets like as follows.

 % sudo ip netns exec host1 ping 192.168.2.2

Then check flow entries in OpenFlow switch.

 % sudo ./trema run /somewhere/apps/flow_dumper/flow_dumper

This will display flow entries created by the controller.
